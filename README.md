In the spirit of lmgtfy.com, Let Me Code That For You!

Use public gists to create links so your friends don't have to code so hard.

Link format is http://lmctfy.co/?{hash} where {hash} = the hash portion of a public gist.github.com url. 

For example, if I want to share the following public gist

https://gist.github.com/joeles/5b3f432f16ba17e8d70e

the lmctfy url is

http://lmctfy.co/?5b3f432f16ba17e8d70e
