# lmctfy
In the spirit of lmgtfy.com, Let Me Code That For You!

Use gists to create links so your friends don't have to code so hard.

Link format is http://lmctfy.co/{hash} where {hash} = the hash portion of a gist.github.com url. 

For example, if I want to share the following gist

https://gist.github.com/joeles/5b3f432f16ba17e8d70e

the lmctfy url is

http://lmctfy.co/5b3f432f16ba17e8d70e
